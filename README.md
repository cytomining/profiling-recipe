# Image-based Profiling Recipe

# Description
The profiling-recipe is a collection of scripts that primarily use [pycytominer](https://github.com/cytomining/pycytominer) functions to [process single-cell morphological profiles](https://github.com/cytomining/pycytominer/blob/master/media/pipeline.png). The three scripts are
- `profiling-pipeline.py` - runs the image-based profile processing pipeline
- `csv2gz.py` - compresses `.csv` files
- `create_dirs.sh` - creates the subdirectories to store the output of the processing pipeline

# Getting Started
## Requirements
### Anaconda
We use Anaconda as our package manager. Install Miniconda following the instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

### AWS CLI
We use AWS S3 storage tracked by DVC for large file management. Install AWS CLI following the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html). After installation, configure your AWS CLI installation with
```bash
aws configure
```
It will prompt you for:  
`AWS Access Key ID:`  YOUR-KEY  
`AWS Secret Access Key:`  YOUR-SECRET-KEY  
`Default region name:` e.g. us-east-1  
`Default output format:` json

Note that the profile that you enter must have permission to upload to the bucket that you set later.

If you do not want to store/version large files on AWS, you can skip AWS CLI installation.

### System requirements
If the profiling pipeline is used for aggregating the single cell profiles, we recommend running the pipeline on a system with a memory at least twice the size of the `.sqlite` files. If the pipeline will be used only for running steps that are downstream of aggregation, then it can be run on a local machine.  

## Creating the folder structure
The pipeline requires a particular folder structure which can be created as follows

```bash
PROJECT_NAME="INSERT-PROJECT-NAME"
mkdir -p ~/work/projects/${PROJECT_NAME}/workspace/{backend,software}
```

## Downloading the data
Download the `.sqlite` file, which contains the single cell profiles and the `.csv` file, which contains the well-level aggregated profiles, for all the plates in each batch to the `backend` folder. These two files are created by running the commands in chapter 5.3 of the [profiling handbook](https://cytomining.github.io/profiling-handbook/create-profiles.html#create-database-backend). After downloading the files, the folder structure should look as follows

```bash
backend
├── batch1
│   ├── plate1
│   │   ├── plate1.csv
│   │   └── plate1.sqlite
│   └── plate2
│       ├── plate2.csv
│       └── plate2.sqlite
└── batch2
    ├── plate1
    │   ├── plate1.csv
    │   └── plate1.sqlite
    └── plate2
        ├── plate2.csv
        └── plate2.sqlite
```

*Note: Aggregation may not have been performed already. In that case, only the `.sqlite` file will be available for download.*

## Welding to the data repository (Recommended)
Welding is a process by which the profiling-recipe repository is added to the data repository as a submodule such that the files in the data repository and the scripts in the profiling-recipe that generated those files, are versioned together. Instructions for welding is provided [here](https://github.com/cytomining/profiling-template#readme). We highly recommend welding the profiling-recipe to the data repository. After welding, clone the data repository to the `software` folder, using the command

```bash
cd ~/work/projects/${PROJECT_NAME}/workspace/software
git clone <location of the data repository>.git
cd <name of the data repository>
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

After cloning, the folder structure should look as follows

```bash
software
└── data_repo
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    └── profiling-recipe
        ├── LICENSE
        ├── README.md
        ├── config_template.yml
        ├── environment.yml
        ├── profiles
        │   ├── profile.py
        │   ├── profiling_pipeline.py
        │   └── utils.py
        └── scripts
            ├── create_dirs.sh
            └── csv2gz.py
```

### Running the recipe without welding
It is possible to run the pipeline without welding the profiling-recipe repository to the data repository. If run in this manner, the profiling-recipe repository should be cloned to a data directory as a subdirectory. Then the folder structure will look as follows.

```
software
└── data_directory
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    └── profiling-recipe
        ├── LICENSE
        ├── README.md
        ├── config_template.yml
        ├── environment.yml
        ├── profiles
        │   ├── profile.py
        │   ├── profiling_pipeline.py
        │   └── utils.py
        └── scripts
            ├── create_dirs.sh
            └── csv2gz.py
```

## Downloading load_data_csv
Generating summary statistics table requires `load_data_csv` files. These files should be downloaded to the `load_data_csv` directory. Make sure the files are gzipped, and the folder structure looks as follows.

```bash
load_data_csv/
├── batch1
│   ├── plate1
│   │   ├── load_data.csv.gz
│   │   └── load_data_with_illum.csv.gz
│   └── plate2
│       ├── load_data.csv.gz
│       └── load_data_with_illum.csv.gz
└── batch2
    ├── plate1
    │   ├── load_data.csv.gz
    │   └── load_data_with_illum.csv.gz
    └── plate2
        ├── load_data.csv.gz
        └── load_data_with_illum.csv.gz
```

# Running the pipeline
The pipeline should be run from the data repository or data directory.

```bash
DATA="INSERT-NAME-OF-DATA-REPO-OR-DIR"
cd ~/work/projects/${PROJECT_NAME}/workspace/software/${DATA}/
```

## Setting up the conda environment
### Copy the environment.yml file
The environment.yml file contains the list of conda packages that are necessary for running the pipeline.

```bash
cp profiling-recipe/environment.yml .
```

### Create the environment

```bash
conda env create --force --file environment.yml
```

### Activate the conda environment

```bash
conda activate profiling
```

## Setting up DVC

Initialize DVC for this project and set it to store large files in S3.
Skip this step if not using DVC.
If you would like to use DVC for a remote storage location that is not S3, find instructions [here](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/remote).
If you have multiple AWS profiles on your machine and do not want to use the default one for DVC, you can specify which profile to use by running `dvc remote modify S3storage profile PROFILE_NAME` at any point between adding the remote and performing the final DVC push. 

```bash
# Navigate
cd ~/work/projects/${PROJECT_NAME}/workspace/software/<data_repo>
# Initialize DVC
dvc init
# Set up remote storage
dvc remote add -d S3storage s3://<bucket>/projects/${PROJECT_NAME}/workspace/software/<data_repo>_DVC
# Commit new files to git
git add .dvc/.gitignore .dvc/config
git commit -m "Setup DVC"
```

## Create the directories
The directories that will contain the output of the pipeline are created as follows

```bash
profiling-recipe/scripts/create_dirs.sh
```

## Metadata, platemap and barcode_platemap files
The pipeline requires `barcode_platemap.csv` and `platemap.txt` to run. An optional `external_metadata.tsv` can also be provided for additional annotation. The following are the descriptions of each of these files

- `barcode_platemap.csv` - contains the mapping between plates and plate maps. There is one such file per batch of data. The file contains two columns whose names are `Assay_Plate_Barcode` and `Plate_Map_Name`, which should not be changed. The name of the file should not be changed either. This file should be a comma-separated `.csv` file.
- `platemap.txt` - contains the mapping between well names and perturbation names. There is one such file per plate map per batch. Two columns are necessary, one with the well names (`A01`, `A02`...) called `well_position` and the other with the perturbation identifier. The name of the perturbation identifier column can be user defined (if changed, change the name in the `config.yml` file). The name of this file can be changed. If changed, also change the name within `barcode_platemap.csv`. This file should be a tab-separated `.txt` file
- `external_metadata.tsv` - contains the mapping between perturbation identifier to other metadata. This file is optional. The perturbation identifier column should have the same name as the column in `platemap.txt`. This file should be a tab-separated `.tsv` file.

The following is an example of the `barcode_platemap.csv` file

```text
Assay_Plate_Barcode,Plate_Map_Name
plate1,platemap
plate2,platemap
```

[Here](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/JUMP-Target/blob/master/JUMP-Target-1_compound_platemap.tsv) is an example plate map file and [here](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/JUMP-Target/blob/master/JUMP-Target-1_compound_metadata.tsv) is an example external metadata file.

These files should be added to the appropriate folder so that the folder structure looks as below

```bash
metadata
├── external_metadata
│   └── external_metadata.tsv
└── platemaps
    ├── batch1
    │   ├── barcode_platemap.csv
    │   └── platemap
    │       └── platemap.txt
    └── batch2
        ├── barcode_platemap.csv
        └── platemap
            └── platemap.txt
```

## Copy the config file
```bash
CONFIG_FILE="INSERT-CONFIG-FILE-NAME"
cd ~/work/projects/${PROJECT_NAME}/workspace/software/${DATA}/
cp profiling-recipe/config_template.yml config_files/${CONFIG_FILE}.yml
```

The config file contains all the parameters that various pycytominer functions, called by the profiling pipeline, require. To run the profiling pipeline with different parameters, multiple config files can be created. Each parameter in the config file is described below. All the necessary changes to the config file must be made before the pipeline can be run.

## Copy aggregated profile
If the first step of the profiling pipeline, `aggregate`, has already been performed (in the `backend` folder, there is a `.csv` file in addition to `.sqlite` file) then the `.csv` file has to be copied to the data repository or data directory. If not, skip to [Running the profiling pipeline](#running-the-profiling-pipeline).

Run the following commands for each batch separately. These commands create a folder for each batch, compress the `.csv` files, and then copy them to the data repository or data directory.

```bash
BATCH="INSERT-BATCH-NAME"
mkdir -p profiles/${BATCH}
find ../../backend/${BATCH}/ -type f -name "*.csv" -exec profiling-recipe/scripts/csv2gz.py {} \;
rsync -arzv --include="*/" --include="*.gz" --exclude "*" ../../backend/${BATCH}/ profiles/${BATCH}/
```

## Running the profiling pipeline

After making the necessary changes to the `config.yml` file, run the profiling pipeline as follows

```bash
python profiling-recipe/profiles/profiling_pipeline.py  --config config_files/${CONFIG_FILE}.yml
```

If there are multiple config files, each one of them can be run one after the other using the above command.

*Note: Each step in the profiling pipeline, uses the output from the previous step as its input. Therefore, make sure that all the necessary input files have been generated before running the steps in the profiling pipeline. It is possible to run only a few steps in the pipeline by keeping only those steps in the config file.*

## Push the profiles to GitHub
If using a data repository, push the newly created profiles to DVC and the .dvc files and other files to GitHub as follows

```bash
dvc add profiles/${BATCH} --recursive
dvc push
git add profiles/${BATCH}/*/*.dvc profiles/${BATCH}/*/*.gitignore
git commit -m 'add profiles'
git add *
git commit -m 'add files made in profiling'
git push
```

If not using DVC but using a data repository, push all new files to GitHub as follows

```bash
git add *
git commit -m 'add profiles'
git push
```

# Files generated

# Config file
## Pipeline parameters
These are the parameters that all pipelines will require

### Name of the pipeline
The name of the pipeline helps distinguish the different config files. It is not used by the pipeline itself.

```yaml
pipeline: <PIPELINE NAME>
```

### Output directory
Name of the directory where the profiles will be stored. It is `profiles` by default.

```yaml
output_dir: profiles
```

### Well name column
Name of the well name column in the `aggregated` profiles. It is `Metadata_well_position` by default.

```yaml
platemap_well_column: Metadata_well_position
```

### Compartment names
By default, CellProfiler features are extracted from three compartments, `cells`, `cytoplasm` and `nuclei`.  These compartments are listed in the config file as follows

```yaml
compartments:
  - cells
  - cytoplasm
  - nuclei
```

If other 'non-canonical' compartments are present in the dataset, then those are added to the above list as follows

```yaml
compartments:
  - cells
  - cytoplasm
  - nuclei
  - newcompartment
```

*Note: if the name of the non-canonical compartment is `newcompartment` then the features from that compartment should begin with `Newcompartment` (only the first character should be capitalized). The pipeline will fail if camel case or any other format are used for feature names.*

### Other pipeline options
```yaml
options:
  compression: gzip
  float_format: "%.5g"
  samples: all
```

- `compression` - The compression format for the profile `.csv`s. Default is `gzip` which is currently the only accepted value.
- `float_format` - The number of significant digits.
- `samples` - Whether to perform the following operations on all or a subset of samples. Default is  `all` which is currently the only accepted value.

## `aggregate` parameters
These are parameters that are processed by the `pipeline_aggregate()` function that interacts with `pycytominer.cyto_utils.cells.SingleCells()` and aggregates single cell profiles to create well level profiles.

```yaml
aggregate:
  perform: true
  plate_column: Metadata_Plate
  well_column: Metadata_Well
  method: median
  fields: all
```

- `perform` - Whether to perform aggregation. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if this should not be performed.
- `plate_column` - Name of the column with the plate name. Default is `Metadata_Plate`.
- `well_column` - Name of the column with the well names. Default is `Metadata_Well`.
- `method` - How to perform aggregation. Default is `median`. Also accepts `mean`.
- `fields` - Cells from which field of view should be aggregated? Default is `all`. If specific fields of view are to be aggregated (for example 1, 4, 9), it can be done as follows

```yaml
fields:
  - 1
  - 4
  - 9
```

Additionally, to add whole image features to the profiles, list the feature categories to the parameter `image_feature_categories`. For example

```yaml
image_feature_catageories:
  - Count
  - Intensity
```

## `annotate` parameters
These are parameters that are processed by the `pipeline_annotate()` function that interacts with `pycytominer.annotate()` and annotates the well level profiles with metadata.

```yaml
annotate:
  perform: true
  well_column: Metadata_Well
  external :
    perform: true
    file: <metadata file name>
    merge_column: <Column to merge on>
```

- `perform` - Whether to perform annotation. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if this should not be performed.
- `well_column` - Column with the well names in the aggregated profiles.
- `external`
	- `perform` - Whether to annotate the profiles with external metadata. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if this should not be performed.
	- `file` - external metadata file which should be in the folder `metadata/external_metadata/`.
	- `merge_column` - Name of the perturbation identifier column that is common to `platemap.txt` and `external_metadata.tsv`.

## `normalize` parameters
These are parameters that are processed by the `pipeline_normalize()` function that interacts with `pycytominer.normalize()` and normalizes all the wells to the whole plate.

```yaml
normalize:
  perform: true
  method: mad_robustize
  features: infer
  mad_robustize_fudge_factor: 0
  image_features: true
```

- `perform` - Whether to perform normalization. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if this should not be performed.
- `method` - Which method to use for normalization. Default is `mad_robustize`. Other options are available in pycytominer, such as, `standardize`, `robustize` and `spherize`.
- `features` - Names of the feature measurement columns. Default is `infer`, which infers CellProfiler features from the annotated profiles.
- `mad_robustize_fudge_factor` - The fudge factor parameter if normalization method is `mad_robustize`.
- `image_features`: Whether whole image features are present in the annotated profiles. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if image features are not present.

### `normalize_negcon` parameters
These are parameters that are processed by the `pipeline_normalize()` function that interacts with `pycytominer.normalize()` and normalizes all the wells to the negative control.

```yaml

- `mad_robustize_fudge_factor` - The fudge factor parameter if normalization method is `mad_robustize`.
- `image_features`: Whether whole image features are present in the annotated profiles. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if image features are not present.

## `feature_select` parameters
These are parameters that are processed by the `pipeline_feature_select()` function that interacts with `pycytominer.feature_select()` and selects features in the whole-plate normalized profiles.

```yaml
  perform: true
  features: infer
  level: batch
  gct: false
  image_features: true
  operations:
    - variance_threshold
    - correlation_threshold
    - drop_na_columns
    - blocklist
```

- `perform` - Whether to perform feature selection. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if this should not be performed.
- `features` - Names of the feature measurement columns. Default is `infer`, which infers CellProfiler features from the normalized profiles.
- `level` - Level at which feature selection should be performed. Default is `batch`. Feature selection can also be performed at `batch` and `all` plates level.

- `image_features`: Whether whole image features are present in the whole plate normalized profiles. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if image features are not present.
- `operations` - List of feature selection operations. `variance_threshold` removes features that have a variance under the threshold, across all the wells on a plate. `correlation_threshold` removes redundant features. `drop_na_columns` removes features with `NaN` values. `blocklist` removes features that are a part of the feature blocklist.

### `feature_select_negcon` parameters
These are parameters that are processed by the `pipeline_feature_select()` function that interacts with `pycytominer.feature_select()` and selects features in the profiles normalized to the negative control.

```yaml
feature_select_negcon:
  perform: true
  features: infer
  level: batch
  gct: false
  image_features: true
  operations:
    - variance_threshold
    - correlation_threshold

    - blocklist
```

- `perform` - Whether to perform feature selection. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if this should not be performed.
- `features` - Names of the feature measurement columns. Default is `infer`, which infers CellProfiler features from the normalized profiles.
- `level` - Level at which feature selection should be performed. Default is `batch`. Feature selection can also be performed at `batch` and `all` plates level.
- `gct` - Whether to create batch level stacked profile and a `.gct` file. Default is `false`. Stacked profiles and `.gct` files are created only when `level` is `batch` or `all`.
- `image_features`: Whether whole image features are present in the negcon normalized profiles. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if image features are not present.
- `operations` - List of feature selection operations. `variance_threshold` removes features that have a variance under the threshold, across all the wells on a plate. `correlation_threshold` removes redundant features. `drop_na_columns` removes features with `NaN` values. `blocklist` removes features that are a part of the feature blocklist.

## `quality_control` parameters
These parameters specify the type of quality control metrics and figures to generate. `summary` generates a table with summary statistics while `heatmap` generates three heatmaps, each showing a different quality control metric.

```yaml
quality_control:
  perform: true
  summary:
    perform: true
    row: Metadata_Row
    column: Metadata_Col
  heatmap:
    perform : true
```
- `perform` - Whether to generate quality control metrics or figures. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if these should not be generated.

There are two different types of qc metrics that can be generated. `summary` creates `summary.tsv` with summary statistics of each plate from each batch. `heatmap` generates three heatmaps - cell count vs. platemap, correlation between the wells and position effect vs. platemap.

```yaml
summary:
  perform: true
  row: Metadata_Row
  column: Metadata_Col
```

- `perform` - Whether or not to generate the summary file. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if this file should not be generated.
- `row` - Row name field in `load_data.csv`.
- `column` - Column name field `load_data.csv`.

```yaml
heatmap:
  perform : true
```

- `perform` - Whether or not to generate heatmaps. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if heatmaps should not be generated.

## `batch` and `plates` parameters
These parameters specify the name of the batch and plate to process.

```yaml
batch: <BATCH NAME>
plates:
  - name: <PLATE NAME>
    process: true
process: true
```

- `batch` - Name of the batch to be processed.
- `plates` -
	- `name` - Name of the plate to be processed.
	- `process` - Whether to process the plate. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if this plate should not be processed.
- `process` - Whether to process the batch. Default is `true`. Set to `false` if this batch should not be processed.

# Rerunning the pipeline
- The instructions in this README assumes that the profiling pipeline is being run for the first time within the data repository. It is possible that you are rerunning the pipeline with a new config file in a repository that already contains profiles. In that case, after cloning the data repository, it is important to download the profiling-recipe submodule and download the profiles from DVC before running the pipeline. This can be done using the following commands

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
dvc pull
```

# Using DVC
Additional information about using DVC that you may find useful:  
When handling large files or a large folder, do NOT add them to GH with `git add`. Instead, add them to DVC with `dvc add`.
This uploads the large file/folder to S3 and creates a pointer to that upload on S3 in the GH repo (that we track instead of the file/folder itself).
It also updates .gitignore so that GH doesn't track the large file/folder itself.
Then `dvc push` to upload the files to S3.

```bash
# Add a file or folder to DVC
dvc add LARGEFILE.csv
dvc push
```
Then add the .dvc version of the file/folder that is created to github along with the .gitignore. Commit.
```bash
git add LARGEFILE.csv.dvc
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "add largefile"
```

## Download data stored by DVC in S3:
 ```bash
# Download ALL data stored by DVC in S3
# Only do this if you really, truly want ALL the data
 dvc pull
 ```
 ```bash
 # Download a specific file stored by DVC in S3
 dvc get https://github.com/ORGANIZATION/DATA-REPO.git relative/path/to/LARGEFILE.csv
 ```
DVC makes files names into hashes in S3. To see the file hash (so you can find it directly on S3) for any given DVC file add the --show-url flag to the `get` command:
  ```bash
  dvc get --show-url https://github.com/ORGANIZATION/DATA-REPO.git relative/path/to/LARGEFILE.csv
  ```
